                      can be:-


                      1. Banded

                      Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing rate on whole balance as balance increases.


                      2. Tiered

                      Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing rate for each tier as balance increases, but interest paid on tier fixed for that tier and not on whole balance.


                      3. Whole

                      The same interest rate is applied irrespective of the BCA balance

                            The annual equivalent rate (AER) is interest that is
                            calculated under the assumption that any interest
                            paid is combined with the original balance and the
                            next interest payment will be based on the slightly
                            higher account balance. Overall, this means that
                            interest can be compounded several times in a year
                            depending on the number of times that interest
                            payments are made.

                      Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing rate on whole balance as balance increases.


                      2. Tiered

                      Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing rate for each tier as balance increases, but interest paid on tier fixed for that tier and not on whole balance.


                      3. Whole

                      The same interest rate is applied irrespective of the PCA balance

                            The annual equivalent rate (AER) is interest that is
                            calculated under the assumption that any interest
                            paid is combined with the original balance and the
                            next interest payment will be based on the slightly
                            higher account balance. Overall, this means that
                            interest can be compounded several times in a year
                            depending on the number of times that interest
                            payments are made.
